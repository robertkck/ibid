<p>Last week the pluralist forum <a href="https://eaepe.org/">EAEPE</a> held its workshop on <em>New ways of innovation policy design and its evaluation - instights from complex adaptive systems and beyond</em>.</p>
<div id="radical-innovation" class="section level1">
<h1>Radical innovation</h1>
<p>The feedback on the presentation related to</p>
<ul>
<li>The results are no surprise and similar to findings from the exploration/exploitation literature and regional lock-in</li>
<li>Single inventors need to be tackled by using a two stage regression approach</li>
<li>Exports could be used as another variable to explain the ties between two regions: Inter-regional industrial connection could lead to radical innovations and cross-fertilisation</li>
<li>New question: How does radicalness relate to regional competitiveness? Is there a U-Shaped relationship between competitiveness and radicalness</li>
<li>Connection to the <em>weak ties hypothesis</em></li>
<li>How does strategic patenting / patent trolls affect the analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideas that come from the feedback are</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduce the model from Agion with radical innovation</li>
<li>Check single inventors with a two stage regression approach</li>
<li>Control for proximity in the goods space</li>
</ul>
<p>Some more ideas from other talks</p>
<ul>
<li>Control for proximity in the technology space and check effect: Hypothesis that high cognitive proximity leads to incremental innovation, but careful with confounding with definition of radicalness</li>
<li>Imrpove radicalness definition. If economic impact is included, more economic controls should be added</li>
<li>Use the RPX</li>
<li>Closely inspect the network structure and investigate other network metrics to control for (e.g. homophily)</li>
<li>Frame as collaboration regression using collaboration as unit of observation</li>
<li>Better specification of distance could be travel time (dykestra, connection between places), see Hidalgo paper on the effect of high-speed train in China</li>
<li>Perform test for joint significance (F-Test) of distance and similarity</li>
<li>Include continental EFTA (Switzerland and Norway)</li>
<li>Can we substitute geographical distance for cognitive or social distance</li>
<li>Use a gravity model</li>
<li>Check Foray’s book on radical transformation building on the ecosystem</li>
</ul>
<div id="data-sets-to-explore" class="section level2">
<h2>Data sets to explore</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Förderkatalog</em> of all German funded projects</li>
<li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.32.3.259">Facebook data</a> on social ties between counties</li>
<li><a href="https://insight.rpxcorp.com/">RPX Patent troll database</a></li>
</ul>

<div id="other-talks" class="section level2">
<h2>Other Talks</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apostolos pointed towards the risk-reward nexus by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/icc/article-abstract/22/4/1093/753299">Mazzucato and Lazonick</a> and that it is important ot affec the mental model of agents</li>
<li>Fritsch talked about the tradeoff between efficiency and novelty in inventor ties and that the discussion about related and unrelated variety is hyped. Both incremental and disruptive innovation is needed.</li>
<li><a href="https://inno.uni-hohenheim.de/bogner">Kristina Bogner</a> took the audience for a tour through the network of bio-economy innovation actors looking for the optimal networ structure for diffusion. At the core was the importance of <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/10/6/1694">dedicated knowledge</a>. She finds a persistend core of innovation actors (old universities, large companies) with a changing periphery. Comparing the network to a small world and scale-free architecture she finds that scale-free networks forster diffusion as the degree distribution is important.</li>
<li><p><a href="http://anet.krtk.mta.hu/team/gergo-toth/">Gergö Tóth</a> and <a href="">Zoltán Elekes</a> presented an interesting paper explaining persistence in inventor ties with geographical, cognitive (tech) and social (collab) proximity between regions. Nice visualisations in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.07637.pdf">paper</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Patenting space is fragmented</li>
<li>National borders are important for collaboration</li>
<li>Scatter plot P(collab) on proximity measures</li>
<li>Gravity approaches of co-inventorship</li>
<li>Zero inflated negative binomial regression (probit?)</li>
<li>Check methodology!</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="http://www.crie.uni-bremen.de/de/mitarbeiter_detail/654-kolja-hesse-msc">Kolja Hesse</a> presented preliminary work on the effect of collaboration between organisations on the radicalness of innovations. He uses a definition of radicalness related to the novelty of IPC combinations.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.microtheory.uni-jena.de/team/members/graf/">Holger Graf</a> a colleague of Martin Kalthaus in Jena presented work on the effect of cluster policy. He is the author of network analysis in R for innovation networks</li>
<li>kene approach by Gilbert 1997. Gilbert, Ahrweiler, Pyka, SKIN Model</li>
<li>Dominique Foray:
<ul>
<li>Mission oriented innovation is an Oxymoron</li>
<li>Man to the moon was a hierarchical, disciplinary, centralised mission</li>
<li>intermediate process between bottom-up and top-down is needed</li>
<li>engineering achievement - discrete innovation goal - structural change</li>
<li>Smart Specialisation (S3) is not to identify a sector, but direction for transformation and select projects for transformation
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Forumalte goal</li>
<li>targeted spending</li>
<li>specific needs</li>
<li>agglomeration and scale effects relatedness not cooperation</li>
<li>strcutural effects</li>
<li>minimise risks</li>
</ol></li>
